# Windows GDI+ fuzzer

this project including
- harness to fuzz GDI+ via transform emf to wmf
- test corpus with good coverage
- vulnerability POC & report generated by <a href="https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId">BugId</a>

Note:

Since the bottleneck of fuzzer is the IO performance of the disk, the use of RAMDISK can effectively speed up this process.
But remember to make a snapshot for your vm-machine or you may lost all of your files (some of my test corpus get lost in this way ,will attach them if recovered).

happy bug hunting!
